## 2019_01_02
### Agenda
    * logistics
    * pieces discussion
    * Discussion

## Logistics
* Contract is moving forward, it is in progress

* 3d printer assembled - moving forward on that
     *how to modify stl -- blender

* No news on Alaska Date
* Meeting with Arctic Sustain in February 13-15 Workshop (maybe have some score/sketch together) -- Christine Hansen (youngest composer in the project)
    * online meeting
    * maybe Jette presents sketches
    * co creation strategy - this seems like the best way to work,
        * may get Jette to Norway to do this

## Ensemble Piece
* ice recording as electronic part...

* **Geir Send**
    * links for performers
    *  All Parrots Yawn (from  - recording & score for piece)
    *  national conservatory has score

## Solo Piece
* interaction between audience and piece
*  Geir interested in humor - interesting provocation for Jette
* solo part writing
* architecture - soloist with ensemble of 3d printed mouthpieces
    * we will start here and maybe move to seperate investigation of 2 mouthpieces for euphonium

## Discussion
* tongue pizzicato -- mouth pop in combination with pitch - very short & any note on euphonium
* Max Patch - Pulse Train, now have version that goes from -1 to 1
    * train is always on, need a way to envelope it
    * Geir is curious about transition time for square wave (Jette - it is either I/O vector or single sample - check reference)
        * _A value of 0 has the smallest "on" pulse size (usually a single sample), while a value of 1 has the largest (usually the entire interval except a single sample)._ (from _signal_ method of _train~_ Reference) This seems to indicate that the transition from one value to the other is a single sample.

## LINKS
* a way to get free stl files [https://www.thingiverse.com/newest]
    * where did Geir get 3d scan of mouthpiece?
* A sofware to manipulate stl's (alternative to OpenScad) [https://www.blender.org/]

## 2018_12_19
### Agenda
    * send links to performers in Artic Sustain - Let Vibrate
    * When in Anchorage? (August - December 2019)
    * thinking about hero/group indivuidual/ensemble - what is the dynamic of the ensemble - leaders, etc.

## Notes
### Ensemble Piece
* Northern Lights Festicval in one Year - @ Culure House - on theme of Northicity-ish -  **feremsmakk** - opposite of talking behind someones back - positive, not hidden, it is public, don't want anything in return - way of confronting established power - confronting what worth people have to each other - positive way of attacking these things - quality is related to who lives in the capitol (what kind of qualities comprise quality) - instead of attacking decisions made about quality, one way is to tell positive stories (create a narative - counter - reveal parallel narratives)
    * thinking about changing what people think and feel, it is not about talk, it is about doing things, agenda is not obvious, but it is underlining.
    * The protest is about mem-afying , more subtle
    * classical contemporary music event - context
    * *sidenote* The Balance Project - Female a day - **JETTE GET** woman scientist a day on Wikipedia (heard on The World - Dec 18) [ https://www.pri.org/file/2018-12-18/physicist-recognized-boosting-women-wikipedia]
     * Date Jan 24 Feb 2 -- need to have score ahead of time
     * [ http://kunstfak.no/prosjekter/arctic-sustain-let-vibrate ] --- plus Lute& Electric Guitar player  (9 people ) can be more
         * Leader model of research groups - this is a chamber music ensemble (Geir is logistical leader) - no clear structure - everyone is involved in Northicity Project - starting to take form - everyone is doubeling / prop orchestra for Norweigen seperatist movement.  - things are very open

* Composer - Jung Peerson - contemporary New Music Society - Royal Music Academy  - Music Informatin - his story is a special one : Opera on riot in 1840's ; Under Cross and Crown - 1985 completed, but they turned it down -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Persen]
    * Edition to the Norweigen Music History
    * $ - 1/2 up front 1/2 on completion - contract in January

### Euphonium moutpiece - Piece
* 2 cups on mouthpiece - cup & throat
* scan of tuba mouthpiece - Geir sent - turning STL into print
* new speaker - what is the model of the new driver Geir got, the phrenolic one that Jette has is [https://www.amazon.com/Selenium-D250-X-Phenolic-Compression-Driver/dp/B00B0MDS06?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-d-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00B0MDS06]
* Technical is dominant in this early stage
    * multichannel amp [ https://www.monacor.com/products/pa-technology/amplifiers/digital-power-amplifiers/sta-850d/]
* Sound Material - good to start considering this and generating some
* modular work - work in different contexts - show up and use whatever brass instruments are available.
* distributed performance - the euphonia are distributed across the space and the audience contributes to (if they choose) by changing timbre with valves & with helping set up instruments.
        * creating a better world is about working with people and adapting the performance situation to be a collaborative event (where possible) - The artist is a member of a community and this piece can make that manifest by having people interact with components of the piece.. or not.
* Euphonium is general neutral  - "we treat euphonium like we treat aquarium"
* Iterative process, not deadline based.
        * We work on iterations of and build the piece collaboratively.
* duet for euphonium soloist & electronicaquarium
* *posibility* solve setup problem by making it part of the performance
